                            <p  style="color:white"><b>Definition:</b>Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil, using a nutrient-rich water solution instead. The roots of the plants are directly immersed in the solution, and a combination of light, temperature, and nutrients are carefully controlled to optimize plant growth. This technique is often used in indoor farming, where space is limited, or in areas with poor soil quality. Hydroponics can be used to grow a variety of crops, including vegetables, fruits, and herbs. </p>

							<p>* Choose a hydroponic system: There are different types of hydroponic systems, including Deep Water Culture (DWC), Nutrient Film Technique (NFT), and Drip System. Choose the one that suits your needs, space, and budget.</p>
<br>
<p> * <b>Choose a growing container:</b> The container should be large enough to hold the plant and the water/nutrient solution. You can use plastic containers, buckets, or even PVC pipes depending on your hydroponic system.</p>
<br>
<p>* <b>Choose a growing medium: </b>The growing medium is what holds the plants in place and provides support. Common growing mediums include Rockwool, coco coir, perlite, vermiculite, and clay pellets.</p>
<br>
<p>* <b>Set up the hydroponic system:</b> Install the system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generally, this involves setting up the container, adding the growing medium, and installing the water pump, tubing, and nutrient solution reservoir.</p>
<br>
<p>* <b>Add the nutrient solution:</b> Mix the nutrient solution according to the manufacturer's instructions and add it to the reservoir. Make sure to maintain the pH level of the solution at the recommended range.</p>
<br>
<p>*<b> Plant the seedlings:</b> Plant the seedlings in the growing medium, making sure that the roots are submerged in the nutrient solution. Place the container in a well-lit area with appropriate temperature and humidity levels.</p>
<br>
<p>* <b>Monitor and maintain: </b>Regularly check the water level and nutrient solution strength, and adjust them as needed. Inspect the plants for signs of pests or diseases, and take necessary action. Prune and harvest the plants when ready.</p>
<br>
These are the basic steps for setting up a hydroponic system. As you gain experience, you can experiment with different hydroponic systems, growing mediums, and nutrient solutions to optimize your plant growth.

<h1 style="color:white"><b>Plants grown by hydroponics</b></h1>
<p>There are many plants that can be grown using hydroponics, including leafy greens, herbs, tomatoes, peppers, strawberries, and even some fruit trees. Here are some common hydroponic plants and their approximate growth times:
<ol>
<li>1) Lettuce: 4-6 weeks</li>
<li>2) Spinach: 4-6 weeks</li>
<li>3) Arugula: 4-6 weeks</li>
<li>4) Basil: 4-6 weeks</li>
<li>5) Mint: 4-6 weeks</li>
<li>6) Tomatoes: 8-12 weeks</li>
<li>7) Peppers: 8-12 weeks</li>
<li>8) Strawberries: 12-16 weeks</li>
<li>9) Cucumbers: 8-12 weeks</li>
<li>10) Melons: 10-16 weeks</li>
</ul>
However, the growth time of the plants will depend on various factors like plant species, hydroponic system used, environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, and lighting. Proper monitoring and management of the hydroponic system and the plants are crucial to achieve optimum growth and yield.

<h1 style="color:white"><b>Growing underground vegetables in Hydroponics</b></h1>
<p >Hydroponics is a type of gardening that involves growing plants in a nutrient-rich water solution, without using soil. Instead, plants are grown in an inert growing medium, such as perlite, coconut coir, or rockwool, which provides support for the plant's roots while allowing water and nutrients to circulate freely.
</p>
<p>Underground plants, like carrots and radishes, can be grown in hydroponics by using techniques that support root growth and development. For example, some growers use net cups or specialized baskets to hold the plants in place and allow their roots to dangle freely in the nutrient solution. Other growers may use a deep water culture (DWC) system, which involves suspending the plant's roots in a nutrient solution that is aerated to promote oxygenation.</p>

<p>there are several types of underground plants that can be grown using hydroponic systems. Some popular options include:
<ol>
<li>1)Carrots</li>
<li>2)Radishes</li>
<li>3)Beets</li>
<li>4)Potatoes</li>
<li>5)Onions</li>
<li>6)Garlic</li>
<li>7)Ginger</li>
<li>8)Turmeric</li>
<li>9)Sweet potatoes</li></ol>
These plants can be grown in a variety of hydroponic setups, such as nutrient film technique (NFT), deep water culture (DWC), or vertical farming systems. However, it's important to note that some underground plants may require more space and specific growing conditions than others, so it's essential to do thorough research before starting a hydroponic garden.</p>
